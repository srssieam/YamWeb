It's made with simple ingredients, including spaghetti, pancetta or guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and a touch of olive oil. The pasta is cooked to al dente, and then it's tossed with a sauce made from eggs, cheese, and crispy pancetta. The result is a luscious, creamy pasta with a perfect balance of flavors. To make this dish, sauté the pancetta until crispy, mix the eggs and cheese, combine with cooked pasta, and toss to coat. Add a generous amount of black pepper for that distinctive flavor. Garnish with extra cheese and serve hot. Spaghetti Carbonara is a true Italian comfort food that's simple yet incredibly satisfying.",
